            <p>
            {{title}} is a small proof-of-concept project. I collected a lot of computer science papers and
            wanted to try the search back end <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/" >Apache Solr</a>.
            Solr is based on lucene, what I already used before. So indexing using Solr is quite easy, just
            store all pdfs,... in one directory and add it to a solr collection
            (so it will need a bit of time, and it requires to increase the used memory up to 5GB).
            </p>
            <h3>Frontend for Solr</h3>
            <p>
            Indexing was quite straight forward, so I was looking for a nice modern front end, but I could not found a suitable one.
            There exists a lot of front ends, but some are ugly, some are ruby and some won't work anymore.
            That's why I created an own web interface using python3, bottle and a bit of javascript magic.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            You collect several papers a whole life in scientific research, it is annoying if you cannot find
            the suitable paper or text:
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                <em>"Information is nothing without retrieval."</em>
            </div>
            Using this approach you always need to have good techniques for getting your needed informations for your local library/collection of papers.

            <p>
            You can look at the github page for more information about local development and setup.
